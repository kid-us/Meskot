              <h4>Meskot: Shattering Borders, Expanding Horizons</h4>
              <p>
                Meskot was born from a simple yet powerful vision: to empower
                Ethiopians to shop beyond limitations. We understand the
                frustration of encountering limited product availability. That
                special gadget unavailable locally? Those designer clothes you
                dream of owning? Meskot shatters geographical restrictions and
                brings the world to your doorstep.

              <h4>More Than Just Shopping, It's a Global Connection</h4>

                connecting Ethiopians with the world and travelers with a unique
